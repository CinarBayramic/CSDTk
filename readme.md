# C Sofware Development Toolkit

## if you are a developer and you are working on a project that unfortunately has one of my projects as a dependency this guide will hopefully make things easy for you.

1) (**OPTIONAL**) run the following command depending on your operating system(you must be in the parent directory of the cloned project

GNU: mv ./CSDTk/* ./
WIN: move "./CSDTk/*" "./"

2) run linux.bash if you are on linux or run windows.ps1 if you are on windows
